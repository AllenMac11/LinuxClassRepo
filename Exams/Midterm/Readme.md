March 18th 2020. See the Code in this directory.

## Part 1
**You must make a PR on this repo containing your three exam questions by March
16th at Midnight**. Your code must work! This is time sensitive, and the whole
class needs you to make these good questions on time so I have a few days to
polish it and work out any kinks before giving the exam on the 18th.

## Part 2 
Come to class and complete the exam you and your peers created in under XYZ
minutes, probably 15 minutes at the end of class. 

## Grading
50% for making good exam questions
50% of your grade will be from your score on the test

## Example Grades:
* You don't do the pull requests to make code, or your code is junk you clearly
  spent 3 minutes on ( 0 pts ) + You get a 100 on the exam ( 100 * 0.50 = 50pts
  ) = 50 on the exam
* You make 3 cute little exam questions, different from the questions your
  friends made ( 50pts ) and then you get a 50 on the exam when you take it (
  50 * 0.50 = 25 pts ) = 75 on the exam
* You make 3 interesting questions, submit a proper pull request, and then
  answer all of the exam questions right = 100 on the exam.

## Should I Withdraw?
We're doing the midterm a bit late because of spring break and usually this exam
is used to help decide whether you withdraw from class or not. The class should get
easier as the semester goes on. I'm showing you exactly what your exam will be.
But if you are terrified of this exam and you still have no idea what the difference
between mv, rm and cp is, and you don't know how to ssh into a Linux machine,
maybe then you should start working much harder or else take that W.
