## Part 1
You must make a PR on this repo containing your three exam questions by March
16th at Midnight. Your code must work! Test it before giving me a PR. Talk to
your friends and to me to make sure your code is good, or do the PR well in
advance of the due date so we can sort it out.

Sending me junk at 11:45 pm is a sure way to get a zero for this part of the
exam.

## Part 2 
Come to class and complete the exam you and your peers created in under XYZ
minutes ( I dunno, maybe 5-10 minutes ).

## Grading
50% for making good exam questions
50% of your grade will be from your score on the test

## Example Grades:
* You don't do the pull requests to make code, or your code is junk you clearly
  spent 3 minutes on ( 0 pts ) + You get a 100 on the exam ( 100 * 0.50 = 50pts
  ) = 50 on the exam
* You make 3 cute little exam questions, different from the questions your
  friends made ( 50pts ) and then you get a 50 on the exam when you take it (
  50 * 0.50 = 25 pts ) = 75 on the exam
* You make 3 interesting questions, submit a proper pull request, and then
  answer all of the exam questions right = 100 on the exam.
