Reset your Digital Ocean Droplet to the Default Debian Config.

Configure a Postgres SQL server on your computer. Add two tables:

A) Students. Columns: First Name, Last Name, ID# 

B) Favorite Movie. Columns: ID#, Favorite Movie Name

Allow me to connect to your server and perform an inner join on the table on the key "ID#".
