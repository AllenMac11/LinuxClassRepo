# Gitlab Server

Setting up a GitLab Server on Digital Ocean is relatively simple and a really beautiful thing to put on a resume. 
GitLab is a website like Github. You can create you own personal Github for yourself and your friends and family.

You will create a server with some code on it that I can clone.

Details and instructions to come.
