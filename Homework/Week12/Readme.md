# Week 12 Homework
In the 

```
LinuxFall2019ClassRepo/Lectures/Week11_FileSystems_And_DiskManagement/Images
```

directory you will find a bunch of images names XX_title.png.


Use what you know about various linux command line tools and awk to change the
file names to XX.png. The output should be like this:

*image of all the files called xx.png instead of xx_title.png*

## Motivation
I am preparing lecture notes for you. I took screenshots of how I added disks to
my VM so that it would be easy for you to complete homework 11. I named the
files XX_descriptivetitle.png. Then, when creating the LaTeX .tex file for the
lecture notes, I thought it was annoying to keep adding my images into the
markup because I needed to know not only the numeric index of the picture (00,
01, etc. ) but also the title of hte picture ( xx_title.png ). How would you
rename the files such that they are all just called XX.png instead of
XX_title.png ? I did it! Let's see if YOU can!
