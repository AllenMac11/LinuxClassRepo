# My Submission

You need to submit the indicated screenshot from the homework submission.

If there's time I'll put a picture of my output, but for now you can have faith I could do the assignment. Sorry for the laziness on my part for not putting the output here. I've shown how to produce the output in lecture, though I've never solved this particular problem.
