# Homework
Create a website for free on github.

I have one that I haven't maintained:
melvyniandrag.github.io

I want you to get one up and running online. Should be a quick project, I think they say it takes only 10 minutes:

official guide:
https://guides.github.com/features/pages/

another source I found on google:
https://gist.github.com/TylerFisher/6127328

you can look around google too if these two dont work for you. 

By INSERT DATE I want to be able to go to yourusername.github.io and see something about XXXX what I want the student to show online.

In the future you can put your resume or pictures of your projects or whatever here
