After running 4 distinct curl requests,the output showed the change in userId, title, and body in the response, while the id remained the same.

# Problem 3
charset = utf-8

# Problem 4

curl -vX POST https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1/posts -d @data.json --header "Content-Type: application/json"

# Problem 5
When I changed the content-type, only userundefined and id showed up as an output. It excluded userId, title, and body. The output was:
 {
  "userundefined": "1",
  "id": 101
}
