# Homework 10

Create a Flask application with five end points that contain some HTML that explains how to use sed. Send me a pull request with your code in the properly formatted directories and a Readme containing the endpoints for your website that I can check. 

Here is a great tutorial about sed:
http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html

For example, your website should have endpoints
167.12.1.289/sed1
167.12.1.289/sed2
167.12.1.289/sed3
167.12.1.289/sed4
167.12.1.289/sed5

and each one should have a little bit of information about sed.

This is a pretty free-form assignment. Make your website as beautiful or as basic as you want in line with how passionate you are for web development.

## Submission guidelines
Pass/Fail. Get the website to work, send me a link to it, and the code via github. If I can access your website and see some interesting info about how to use sed, I'll be happy.
