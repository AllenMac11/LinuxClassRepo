# Homework 10

Create a Flask application with five end points that contain some HTML that explains how to use sed. Send me a pull request with your code in the properly formatted directories and a Readme containing the endpoints for your website that I can check. 

## Submission guidelines
Pass/Fail. Get the website to work, send me a link to it, and the code via github. If I can access your website and see some interesting info about how to use sed, I'll be happy.
