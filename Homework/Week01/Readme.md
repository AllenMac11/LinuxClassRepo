# Homework 1
I expect all of this to take about 3 hours, and I hope you find it fun and rewarding. At the end of this assignment you'll be quite good at a number of \*nix things.

## Assignment
1. Play up to level 4 of vim adventures:

Submit a screenshot indicating that you are playing on a machine that is yours.

2. Watch the Derek Banas video on Bash.

Submit a screenshot showing an open terminal doing some stuff and the video playing in the background on your machine.

3. Use vim to write an .txt file with a explanation of what each of the Linux commands we learned today does. Your file must be different from every one else's file - do your own work! An example line from your .txt file:

```
cp file1 file2 - make a copy of file1 called file2
```

## Submission Guidelines:
Due Monday, September 9th by Midnight ( the midnight between monday and tuesday ). 
Email me all homework materials to my njcu email address. 
Remember:
1. Your screenshots should indicate you did the work on a machine that belongs to you
2. Your .txt file must be uniquely yours. To grade I'm going to run your submissions through a few Bash programs I wrote to make sure the submission is QUITE unique.

## Addendum
Deadlines are strict in this class as I want to make sure you've finished your work a few days before class so that you can properly digest the material. In the past I've seen people hurrying to do the assignment 2 minutes before class, so their brains haven't had time to subconsciously process the really cool things they've just done. If the work is done a few days early, you'll have time to think about what you've done and spend a few days playing with Linux with no pressure.
