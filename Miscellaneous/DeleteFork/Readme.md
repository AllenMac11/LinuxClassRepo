# Delete your Fork on Github

You might come across problems trying to make a pull request if you created your
fork a long time ago. Later in the semester I'll explain why; there is no time
for explaining now. As a work around, just delete your old fork. 

It's pretty easy, look at the pictures I took below.

[step 2](02_clickSettingsForFork.png)
[step 3](03_scrollToBottomOfSettings.png)
[step 4](04_deleteYourFork.png)

Then you can create a pull request [as explained
here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN39W7P4Mc).
