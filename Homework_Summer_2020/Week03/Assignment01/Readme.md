# Your first pull request

In this assignment you will make your first contribution to a software project
on github. You must

* Fork the class repository
* clone your fork to your Linux server.
* create a directory inside this directory called `FirstNameLastName`. Note that
as an example I already create a directory called `MelvynDrag`. 
* inside that folder you must complete the python3 code `math.py` that I wrote
in the `MelvynDrag` directory. You will need to complete the `mul()` and `div()`
methods.
* add, commit and push your changes to your fork on github.
* open a pull request on my copy of `LinuxClassRepo`

## Submission guidelines.

Open the PR ( Pull Request ) no later than 11:59 PM of Sunday, June 7th.
The python3 code must be correct and work. Note that for this assignment YOU DO
NOT NEED TO SUBMIT ANYTHING ON BLACKBOARD.
