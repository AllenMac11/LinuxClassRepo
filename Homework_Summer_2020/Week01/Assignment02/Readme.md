# Learn Some Command Line Syntax

In this assignment you will demonstrate you know how to do basic stuff on the command line. This will be essential to doing projects in the coming weeks. I already know this stuff! Make sure you do too!

Handwrite an explanation of the following commands twice. I'm asking you to write it twice so you don't forget. I figure if you write it twice you have a good chance to remember, and it's easy for me to grade so everyone wins.

* cp
* cp -r
* cd
* mkdir
* mkdir -p
* rm 
* rm -r
* cat
* ls
* ls -l
* ls -r
* ls -t
* ls -ltr
* cd .
* cd ..
* cd ~
* mv
* touch
* wc
* wc -l
* wc -c
* wc -w
* echo
* cut -b
* cut -c
* md5sum

Use all of these commands on the command line. It's all well and good to write, but I need you to actually do stuff too.

## Submission guidelines

Submit PNG or JPG *selfies* of yourself with your two handwritten homeworks. 

Submit a PNG or JPG *screenshot* of a handful of these commands being run in a terminal.
Don't worry about all of them, just as many as you can fit in one image.

Due by 11:59 PM of May 24th and not a second later! Submit on blackboard. If you can't submit all your files then send a zip or rar archive.
