# Basic Git + Github Usage

In this assignment you'll demonstrate basic knowledge of git and github.

Todo:
* Create a NEW digital ocean server *(make sure you delete your old ones)*
* Create a directory called *MyFirstJavaDirectory*
* Make a java program that says 'My name is ...'
* add and commit your .java file
* Change your program so it says 'My favorite programming language is ...'
* add and commit your .java file
* Change your program so it says 'I am taking CS407 because ...'
* add and commit your program
* Change your program so it says 'My favorite food is ...'
* add and commit your program
* Push your repo to github
* Send me the link to your github repo

I will clone your repo ( aka 'repository' ) and I expect it to show your 4 commits, and if I checkout anyone of them, it should show the indicated information.

## Submission Guidelines

Due May31st by 11:59PM and not a second later.
Submit the URL of your repository by the indicated time. I will clone your repo and verify that you have the indicated 4 commits. Then I'll learn a bit about you and give you a 100. There must be 4 commits, don't mess around with me by putting 2 commits!

Also, if I checkout anyone of your commits I should be able to compile and run your .java file, showing me the required information.

For 100% credit you must show me 4 commits and each commited .java file should compile and run.
