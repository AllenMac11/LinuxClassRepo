# About this file

This java program runs on the BeagleboneBlack, running embedded linux, and can control the flow of electricity to peripherals.
This program demonstrates the power of embedded linux by allowing you to toggle an LED on the Beaglebone Black.

A light turning on and off might not seem like much, but think bigger - since you can control the flow of electricity to an led, you can control the flow of electricity to motors, sensors, and other crazy devices to build robots, spy gadgets, home automation devices, etc.. 

Cool!
