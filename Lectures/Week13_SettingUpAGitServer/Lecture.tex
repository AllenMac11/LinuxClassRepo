\begin{abstract}
Tonight we will practice for the final exam. Then we will look at a couple of
final Linux topics that we haven't had time for yet.
\end{abstract}

\section{Final Exam Problem Statement and Motivation} 
\subsection{The Scenario}
\begin{enumerate}
\item You are an employee at a company writing software on a laptop.
\item You need to backup your code using git.
\item Your company doesn't trust github because your code is secret and cannot
be on the internet
\item Therefore you must create a git server on a Linux machine the company
controls.
\item You need to configure the server such that 
\begin{itemize}
\item You can push code from your laptop to the server
\item Your colleague can clone code from the server to his laptop
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Final Exam}
The problem we will do is you will need to create two fresh Digital ocean
servers in class. One will emulate your laptop described in the scenario above (
we will refer to this as the `git client').
The other will represent the company git server ( we will refer to this as the
`git server'). You need to configure the git server such that you can push a
repo from the client to the server. Then, I need you to add my laptop's
id\_rsa.pub key to your git server's authorized\_keys file so that I can clone
the repo from there.

If you practice you can complete this exam in 5 minutes. If you don't practice
you will likely be unable to complete the task. Make sure you practice, this
assignment is pass/fail, 0/100.

\section{How to do it}
\subsection{Create two Digital Ocean Debian 10 VMs}
If time, put pictures here of the vm creation.

\subsection{Configure the Server}

We need to install some software, add a special user, and create an empty git
repo to store our code.
\begin{lstlisting}
root@digitalocean-gitserver$ apt update
root@digitalocean-gitserver$ apt install git-core curl
root@digitalocean-gitserver$ adduser git
#answer questions
root@digitalocean-gitserver$ su - git
git@digitalocean-gitserver$
git@digitalocean-gitserver$ cd
git@digitalocean-gitserver$ pwd
#/home/git
git@digitalocean-gitserver$ git init --bare final_exam.git
\end{lstlisting}

We will need the ip address of this machine when we use it as a remote. Remember
that up until this point we have been using github as our remote - now we are
setting up our OWN git server. We don't need github now, because we are making
our OWN github. For now, just figure out the ipaddress of your server.

\begin{lstlisting}
git@digitalocean-gitserver$ curl ipinfo.io/ip
111.222.333.444
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Configure the client}
Install necessary things. 

Create a repo

Create ssh keys

\begin{lstlisting}
root@digitalocean-gitclient$ apt update
root@digitalocean-gitclient$ apt install git
root@digitalocean-gitclient$ adduser ashketchum
root@digitalocean-gitclient$ su - ashketchum
\end{lstlisting}

Now create some code,
\begin{lstlisting}
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$ cd
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$ pwd
/home/ashketchum
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$ mkdir FinalExamCode
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$ cd FinalExamCode
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$ vim mycode.sh
# add some stuff to the file.
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$ cat mycode.sh
echo 'hello world!'
\end{lstlisting}

Then configure your local git repository.
\begin{lstlisting}
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$ pwd
/home/ashketchum/FinalExamCode
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$ git config --global user.email
"ash@pallet.town"
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$ git config --global user.name "Ash Ketchum"
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$git init
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$git add mycode.sh
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$git status
# shows added code not yet committed
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$git commit -m "first commit"
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$git status
#shows your code is committed
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$git remote add origin
git@111.222.333.444:final_exam.git
# Put the ipaddress of the machine digitalocean-gitserver.
# remember that we got the ipaddress before.
\end{lstlisting}

Now create an ssh key you can use when pushing your code the the server.
\begin{lstlisting}
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$ ssh-keygen
# does stuff.
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa 1hd+alkhgienalX1222 ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$ # you will need to paste that key in the
authorized_keys file on your git server.
\end{lstlisting}

Now we will put this key on our server. You can try to push your code to the
server now, but you will see it will fail. The key is not on the machine so it
won't work.

\begin{lstlisting}
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$ pwd
/home/ashketchum/FinalExamCode
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$git push origin master
# NOPE
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Put your ssh key on digitalocean-gitserver}

Put the key there however you wish. Copying from \textit{digitalocean-gitclient} and pasting it into the
\textit{/home/git/.ssh/authorized\_keys} file on \textit{digitalocean-gitserver} is probably easiest.

\begin{lstlisting}
git@digitalocean-gitserver$ mkdir ~/.ssh
git@digitalocean-gitserver$ touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
git@digitalocean-gitserver$ # now put the key in that file however you wish.
git@digitalocean-gitserver$ cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
ssh-rsa 1hd+alkhgienalX1222 ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Push to the server}
Go back on the client and push your code. It should work now!

\begin{lstlisting}
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$ pwd
/home/ashketchum/FinalExamCode
ashketchum@digitalocean-gitclient$git push origin master
# This time it works.
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Back to the final exam.}
For the final exam, I want to be able to clone your code to my laptop. Now the
code is sitting there on the \textit{digitalocean-gitserver} machine. If you put
my ssh key from my laptop on the server, I should be able to clone the code. If
I can successfully clone the code, you get a 100. My ssh key will be provided
during the exam. 

I will try to clone your code by running ( from my laptop ):
\begin{lstlisting}
melvyn@laptop$ git clone git@111.222.333.444:final_exam.git
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
{\LARGE Have students share their id\_rsa.pubs and clone each others repos. For
example, have `Mike' give `Tiffany' the contents of his id\_rsa.pub and have
here put it in the authorized\_keys file on her \textit{digitalocean-gitserver}}.
Then have him attempt to clone her code.
\end{center}

And then one more detail.



\subsection{Further reading}
This is only one way to set up a git server. There are at least a few other
ways, and there are still many questions you might have about git - now you need
to go RTFM. We've been using git and github for a few months, and now you've
even set up a server. You can now confidently pick up \textit{the book} and read
it and learn more details about this extremely complex program. Here is
\textit{the book} online for free, but you can also order the paperback off
amazon if you like that better.

\begin{center}
\url{https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2}
\end{center}

in particular you are probably interested in the section about setting up git
servers:

\begin{center}
\url{https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-The-Protocols}
\end{center}
\section{Gitlab}

You will see that what the notes above described is setting up git to use the
SSH Protocol ( hence why you have to put you ssh key on the server ). That
section of the book describes some other protocols you could use for your git
server.

\section{Important Reminder!}
This is your final exam. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item We've just done it together
\item I've written quite thorough notes documenting the procedure.
\item If you don't like my writing style, I've also given you a link to the
 reference book these notes are based on. 
\item You have 2 weeks to study before the exam
\end{enumerate}

{\LARGE\textbf{A few people came to the midterm underprepared. I gave an
extension for that. There are NO extensions for the final exam. I wont answer
any questions or troubleshoot any problems during the exam - YOU have to study
and master this little bit of information. Practice this a
couple of times at home until you can do the whole process in 5 minutes, then
come in and get an easy A.} We meet at 8PM, I'm hoping that we can all be done
in a half hour and go home early.}

\section{Final Interesting Topic 1: \textit{join}}

\begin{center}
\url{https://www.bsdnow.tv/306}
\end{center}

Refer to the "BSD Now" Podcast Episode 306: Comparing Hammers. Listen to around
21 minutes in. Discussion of join, awk, grep, command line relational database
on BSD. Pretty cool stuff you could understand now! Also note that right before
this they are talking about Hammer vs. Hammer 2, which are file systems types on
BSD ( not available on Linux )

Do you remember what are some common Linux file system types?

Note at 21:40 they say Postgres Server! You made one of those! You can listen to
hte pro BSD podcasts now and confidently say to yourself that you've done the
things they are talking about.

\subsection{Back to \textit{join}}
I gave two files you can use to test this cool command. One is
\textit{students.sorteddata}

\lstinputlisting{students.sorteddata}

and the other is \textit{roomnumber.sorteddata}

\lstinputlisting{roomnumber.sorteddata}

And note that we can do an inner join on them using the \textit{join} command!

\begin{lstlisting}
melvyn@laptop$ join -1 2 -2 1 -t"," students.sorteddata roomnumber.sorteddata
biology,katyusha,202
chemistry,igor,106
math,boris,101
math,svetlana,101
\end{lstlisting}

See?? It does an inner join!

If you use the unsorted data files in the repo you will see that it complains,
it wants the data sorted.

\subsection{\textit{join} and \textit{awk}}
In the podcast they go on to say you can use awk and grep to do your SELECT *
WHERE X = Y operations you know from our brief discussion of SQL when we set up
the postgres server. Can you do the join and then use awk to print the lines
where the subject is math?

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{auk.jpg}
  \caption{This bird is an auk. The language is called AWK because the language creators are Aho,
Weinberger and Kernighan ( A. W. K. ), and `AWK' sounds like `auk'.}
\end{figure}



\section{Final Interesting Topic 2: Linux on an Atmel Microcontroller}
You are computer science majors, or techy types - look at the cool stuff your
peers are working on:
\url{https://dmitry.gr/index.php?r=05.Projects&proj=07.%20Linux%20on%208bit}
This fellow got Linux ( which expects a 32bit or 64bit architecture to run ) to
run on a teensy 8 bit Atmel microcontroller. This guy gathered a bunch of
electronics pieces and soldered them onto a circuit board. He then programmed a
CPU emulator in C that tricked Linux into thinking the 8 bit microcontroller 
was actually 32 bits. Then he installed a carefully chosen Linux image onto his
little computer, and then it worked! 
It's just an amazing display of hardware and software knowledge that this
creative person  pulled together to do something that others said was
impossible. 

This guy, Dmitry Grinberg, had a full time job, family and a bunch of hobbies
while he did this.

\section{Keep Learning and Keep Doing Cool Stuff}
Read lots of books, learn a few programming languages, do some projects, it's
good for you.
