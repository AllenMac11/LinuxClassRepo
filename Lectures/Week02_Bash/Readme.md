## [ 7:00 - 7:30 ] pipes
One of the best parts of Linux Shell Scripting is pipes. Pipes allow you, along with a few other commands that we'll cover shortly, to chain simple command line tools together. This is the essence on \*nix, scripting, really - chain together a bunch of simple but thoroughly tested ( and correct ) programs to do something larger and more interesting. 

Good commands to use with pipes:
* sort
* uniq
* md5sum
* cut
* sha256
* cut -b
* cut -c
* cat
* echo
* tee
* 



For a better example, let's find the largest number in a file of numbers.

`See Code/NumbersPipeExample` where we find the largest number in txt file with a chain of piped commands.

### 7:25 Exercises
Have class experiment with pipes to make sure they understand.

## [ 7:30 - 8:00 ] if/test/comparisons

### 7:50 Exercises 
Have class write some if/else/test comparisons to make sure they understand.


## [ 8:00 - 8:05 ] break
Much needed break.

## [ 8:45 - 8:55 ] pidof
## [ 8:55 - 9:00 ] A look at 'file descriptors'
## [ 9:00 - 9:05 ] break
## [ 9:05 - 9:35 ] More important linux commands
## [ 9:35 - 9:45 ] homework discussion.
